# ChefAssistant
## Description

Our project compares the effectiveness of two chatbots—the Linguistic chatbot and the ChatGPT API-based chatbot—intended to help users generate recipes. A linguistic chatbot, fine-tuned for this task, employs advanced natural language understanding to promptly deliver recipes tailored to user inputs. On the other hand, the ChatGPT based chatbot provides a supplementary method with advanced language creation capabilities, driven by OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. We try to provide insight into each model's advantages and disadvantages by carefully examining aspects such as response quality and accuracy, flexibility, usefulness, and ease of use. We want to improve user experiences and optimize database interactions by using these findings to direct future improvements in AI-assisted recipe formulation.
